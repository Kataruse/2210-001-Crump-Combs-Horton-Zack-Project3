# Project3 Warehouse

## Description
In this assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding and proficiency in the data
structures we have discussed in this class up to this point: arrays, lists, stacks, queues, and
priority queues.

  You have been contracted to a local company about to build a new warehouse processing
center. They are unsure about the necessary capacity of the warehouse, so they want you to
develop simulations of the warehouse to help them determine what gets built. Succinctly, the
company wants you to determine how many dock’s the warehouse should have to maximize total
revenue once built.
  In the simulation, trucks arrive with random cargo crates loaded into their trailers. Each
truck’s trailer has a random number of crates. Each truck arrives at a random time across 48
discrete time increments. The trailers are loaded back to front such that the first crate placed into
the trailer is the last crate to leave. Once they arrive to the warehouse, they are immediate sent
to a gate entrance to await further processing. Once every time increment, a truck can be added
to a loading dock.
  Once at a loading dock, a truck can have exactly one crate unloaded every time
increment. Once a truck is completely unloaded, it is immediately swapped with next truck in line
for that dock. This way, one-time increment unloads the last crate off of one truck, and the very
next time increment unloads the first crate off the next truck.
  Tracking the amount of time each dock is in use and how much money it generates is
important, as each dock takes approximately $100 to operate for each time increment.
Once the simulation is complete, it should generate a report with the following information:

* The number of docks open during the simulation.
* The longest line at any loading dock during the simulation.
* The total number of trucks that were processed during the simulation.
* The total number of crates that were unloaded during the simulation.
* The total value of the crates that were unloaded during the simulation.
* The average value of each crate unloaded during the simulation.
* The average value of each truck unloaded during the simulation.
* The total amount of time that a dock was in use.
* The total amount of time that a dock was not in use.
* The average amount of time that a dock was in use.
* The total cost of operating each dock.
* The total revenue of the warehouse (total value of crates – total operating cost)
